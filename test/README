This directory is used to compile and execute all of the automated tests for
OpenSSL. For information on how to write new unit/automated tests, see:

  http://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Unit_Testing

To generate a new unit/automated test stub in an OpenSSL subdirectory, run:

  $ [OpenSSL root dir]/new-test.sh foobar

This will create a new foobar_test.c in the current directory.
